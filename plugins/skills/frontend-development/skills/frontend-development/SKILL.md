name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with exceptional design quality. Two modes - (1) New projects - bold aesthetic design philosophy including typography, color theory, spatial composition, motion design, visual details, avoiding generic AI aesthetics, creating unforgettable interfaces. (2) Existing codebases - mandatory design language analysis enforcing consistency by scanning layout patterns, typography hierarchy, component structure, spacing, theme systems before implementation. Use when building components, pages, applications, design systems, UI modifications. Covers React, Vue, Next.js, HTML/CSS, Tailwind. Keywords - create component, build page, design interface, add UI, aesthetic design, visual design, typography, animations, spatial layout, design system, consistency, pattern analysis, existing codebase.

# Frontend Design Skill

This skill provides two distinct workflows for creating production-grade frontend interfaces:

## Scenario Detector

**Answer this question:** Is there an existing codebase with components, pages, or a design system?

### ✅ YES → Existing Codebase (Most Common)
**Use this workflow:** [EXISTING-CODEBASE-CHECKLIST.md](EXISTING-CODEBASE-CHECKLIST.md)

**Purpose:** Enforce design language consistency by analyzing existing patterns before implementation.

**When to use:**
- Adding components to existing project
- Creating new pages in existing app
- Modifying UI in established codebase
- Working with design system

**Process:** Mandatory 3-phase checklist (Design Analysis → Decisions → Implementation)

---

### ✅ NO → New Project (Greenfield)
**Use this workflow:** [NEW-PROJECT-DESIGN.md](NEW-PROJECT-DESIGN.md)

**Purpose:** Create bold, distinctive aesthetic design from scratch.

**When to use:**
- Starting new projects
- Building standalone components/pages
- No existing design system to match
- Full creative freedom

**Process:** Design thinking → Aesthetic principles → Implementation
